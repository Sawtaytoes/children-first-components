# Children-First Components
This library is currently a work-in-progress to build the React components found in this talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n62Pc4KV4SM).

You can use this as inspiration or copy-paste directly, but please reference where you got the code (and give me, Kevin Ghadyani, credit) so you can eventually switch over to the library I'll be publishing.

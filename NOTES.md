- Rename `toggleVisibility` and others to not have the `visibility` part. It's implied because there's only 1 state now.
- Remove `contentId` and `triggerId` from Visibility. Leave this up to consumers to figure out.
- Try again to type with `ComponentType` in `cloneElement`, but specify other props are unknown.
- Move `translateProps` to `VisiblityChild` and remove it from `VisibilityTrigger` and `VisibilityTarget`.
- Remove tight-coupling between types in `useVisibility` and `VisibilityProvider`.

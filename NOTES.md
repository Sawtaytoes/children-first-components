- Add `VisibilityControlProvider`.
- Add method to link multiple contexts.
- Change `visibility` to `isVisible`. No reason for this to be separate anymore. It simplifies a lot of code too. Figure out what to do about `onVisibilityChange`.
- Potentially rename `onVisibilityChange` to `onChange`.
- Try again to type with `ComponentType` in `cloneElement`, but specify other props are unknown.
- Move `translateProps` to `VisiblityChild` and remove it from `VisibilityTrigger` and `VisibilityTarget`.
- Remove tight-coupling between types in `useVisibility` and `VisibilityProvider`.

- Move create key function into hook because of memoization and fallback. This allows people to use it more easily.
- Use the hook in useVisibility and pass the key into the shared context instead of creating it there.
- Return useScopedAtom from the shared context hook creator instead of the object that's currently there.
- The fallback context key should be in useVisibility instead of the shared context.
